I'm a 12 years experienced programmer. i have run several php, python and java projects. Am good with php, java, mysql, javacript, ajax, xml/dom, css. i am the right guy for any frontend or backend system development, mostly backend. I am more of a software architect and i am a team player.
I am definitely the right man for the job across the western africa(Nigeria in specific).
I am currently running a project in search Engine Tools.
